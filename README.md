# Transformer: Fraud-End-to-End-Fraud-Detection-for-E-Commerce-Payments
This repository implements a  Transformer-based fraud detection system for online payment transactions, built upon the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. The framework combines TimeGAN and Transformer architectures to effectively capture both temporal patterns and anomalous behaviors in financial transactions.

End-to-end solution for the [Kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) competition.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
Predict whether an online transaction is fraudulent (isFraud=1) based on anonymized identity & transaction records.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- **Train**: 590k transactions (3.5% fraud)  
- **Test**: 506k transactions  
- **Files**: train_transaction.csv, train_identity.csv, test_*.csv, sample_submission.csv  
- **Size**: ~5 GB uncompressed
